    'My life': `
    
    I was born on 4th octomber in 2004. A couple
    years later my parents moved to General Toshevo.
    I grew up in a very nice class with
    every kid being nice and good in school.
    This environment helped got a fabulous childhood.
    I never really had any interests or hobbies. I would
    just play games all day and go out with
    my friends. A very simple life. However
    When i started 8th grade i found an 
    udemy course that i wanted to try. 
    This was the first step to start coding.
    Later on i found about softuni and got
    excellent programming knowledge of three
    languages. In school we started studying
    web design so I knew how to use a technolodgy
    for both front and back end.

    I enjoy playing games with cars. I love solving the rubik's cube.
    Motorcycles are also a huge hobby of mine.
    More of riding them than fixing them tho.
    My favourite hobby is programming but it's
    not a hobby anymore since I have decided 
    to do programming as my job in the future.
